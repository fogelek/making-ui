        <h2>Michal Fogelman</h2>
        <p><strong>UI developer, Software Engineer, Wannabe UI designer</strong></p>
        <p>Hi, I'm Michal, known also as Fogel. As a Software Engineer at Microsoft, I strive to make the Web a prettier and more comfortable place. I went through backend, database and API development, software architecture design, to find my home in the most user facing area. Now, I want to share my knowledge, findings, successes and failures.</p>
        <p>Besides development I tend to spend most of my free time cycling, planning new routes or looking for new places to visit with my bike, the steeper, the better!</p>
