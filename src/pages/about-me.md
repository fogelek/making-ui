    <h2>Fogel</h2>
    <p><strong>UI developer, Software Engineer, Wannabe UI designer</strong></p>
    <p>Hi, I'm Fogel. As a Software Engineer at Microsoft, I strive to make the Web a prettier and more comfortable place. I went through backend, database and API development, software architecture design, to find my home in the most user facing area. Now, I want to share my knowledge, findings, successes and failures.</p>
    <p>I am autistic and ADHD'er. As a neurodivergent person I have dedicated part of my journey and voice to learn and advocate about accessibility for cognitive disabilities. These are often overlooked, and yet are crucial to make internet more inclusive place.</p>
    <p>Besides development I tend to spend most of my free time learning to play a guitar or cycling, planning new routes or looking for new places to visit with my bike, the steeper, the better!</p>
